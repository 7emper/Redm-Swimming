# Redm-Swimming
This script offers configurable options through simple true/false statements in the client.lua file.

What does this script do?

This script provides players with the ability to swim indefinitely, prevents the map border sink zones that rapidly drain your cores and sink your boat.
Additionally, it includes boat invulnerability as an optional feature. I believe this feature is beneficial as it prevents boats from sinking due to minor collisions with rocks or a single shot fired at your canoe. 
On the other hand, having a god mode boat shouldn't cause any harm. It's worth noting that although players remain vulnerable, the boats themselves will not sink unless they are out of render distance for an extended period of time.
